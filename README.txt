1)This folder contains the files with genome sequences of the banana streak family virus(to be used for training and testing).

2)The banana_all contains the appended the genome sequence from all the banana streak family viruses used for the getting the transition and emission probabilities.

3)The bac1 is a bacterial genome of Acetobacter aceti used for testing.

##python code:
4) frequency.py = to calculate the initial frequencies of ACTG and start/stop codons in the banana streak families.
5) probabilities.py : python code to find out emission and transition probability matrices
6) calculating_scores.py : python code to find out log prob scores of genomes of banana streak family virus
7) classifier.py :python code to classify the given genome sample
